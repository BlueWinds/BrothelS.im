Running the game
=============

From the server (recommended):
  1. Visit brothels.im, or dev.brothels.im (dev is less stable, but sometimes has neat features and additional content not yet introduced).

From your local machine (simple version):
  1. Double click on WebServerLite.jar
    a. If your computer is unsure how to run this file, you need to download and install Java Runtime Environment. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html
  2. Open your browser, and put 127.0.0.1 in the address bar.

Note that WebServerLite.jar is just a bloody simple webserver which echoes files in its directory to 127.0.0.1. There's nothing dynamic about this program - it's just that modern browsers are pretty picky about ajax requests on the file:// protocol (with good reason - doesn't make it any less annoying).
