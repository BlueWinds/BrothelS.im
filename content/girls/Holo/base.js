  description: "<p>Holo has a lovely figure, long flowing hair, wolf ears, and a beautiful brown tail with a splash of white at the end. She sometimes has to wear baggy clothing that hides her unusual features, though she dislikes this as she takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it. She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient and refers to herself as the \"Holo the Wise Wolf\". She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. Holo longs to return to Yoitz, her snowy homeland, and has made it this far north via a traveling merchant. Though reluctant, she's willing to work for you to raise the rest of the money she needs for her northern expedition.</p>",

The note spells out clearly that Holo owes a substantial amount of money to Medio Trading Company, and the local branch has been authorized to take her into debt-slavery as part of that land's usury laws - it also contains a writ from the king of this place to collect, by any means necessary. Though she never let you know, it seems as though Holo's situation was much the same as your own when she arrived, and her creditors are far less understanding.<br><br>The note gives two options for paying the $30000 that Holo owes, the first of which invites you to pay her debt outright for her safe return and gives an address. Alternatively, Medio Trading Company intends to whore out Holo themselves, giving the assurance that they'll return Holo in ten days. You can only imagine what kind of conditions Holo would have to work in to make them $3000 daily, and it likely involves some particularly depraved jobs for high-paying clients, with little - if any - time for rest. The risk to Holo's health seems severe.",
