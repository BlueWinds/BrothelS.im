You nod to Sakuya - she takes her mistress\'s outstretched hand and turns to face you to say goodbye. A flicker of disapproval crosses Scarlet\'s face, but she doesn\'t interrupt. <blockquote>I will have payment delivered by morning.</blockquote> The Devil frowns at you, clearly not as pleased with you as you had expected, but happy to have Sakuya back nonetheless. She kisses her maid\'s cheek, and they\'re gone. Not walking together down the street, but there one moment, gone the next, the same way Sakuya used to do while cleaning. With a sigh you turn homeward.",

Not very much, it seems - except her mistress, occasionally. She finds her relationship with you odd - working for you, but... it takes a while to get her to finish the sentence. But not dominated or controlled by you, it finally comes out. You suspect she might enjoy a stronger hand on the leash, as it were. Perhaps a literal leash, even."
