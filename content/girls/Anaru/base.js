Eventually she grew apart from her childhood friends, though she could not forget Menma, the lively girl that she both admired and envied. Easily influenced by others, she made some disreputable friends, and was on the wrong path in life when, without warning, adventure knocked in the form of a vortex. She was suddenly and unexpectedly brought to Valaia, and is wondering what to do now that her former life is nothing but a memory.</p>",

There is nobody in the first room, and the door to the second room is open. A faint whimpering comes from this room, so you tiptoe to investigate. The only person in this second room is a girl bound and with most of her clothing removed. Her legs are not restrained, so you and Anaru bring her to her feet as silently as you can. The three of you sneak back outside, and the girl looks at you appreciatively.<blockquote>Chii... Chii...</blockquote>With those unexplained words, she runs down the street still bound and almost nude. With her captors likely to notice her absence soon, you and Anaru make sure to leave quickly too, relieved that you noticed this stranger\'s plight.' // This is vague, but the image implies more. To consider in the future: add slight wording variation to suggest a tiny bit more has taken place if Game.fetishes[variable] allows.
