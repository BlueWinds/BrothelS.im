Laughing at her enthusiasm as the two of you enter, you announce that you\'ll get her any one thing. This proves to be... a mistake.<br><br>The giant lollipop in the center of the store? The one that looked like an ornamental stand? It was real, it was for sale, and you had to carry it home since it was too heavy for Mana to carry. You wonder how long it will take her to finish it, and whether you should invest in some earplugs in the meantime."
