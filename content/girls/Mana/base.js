Laughing at her enthusiasm as the two of you enter, you announce that you'll get her any one thing. This proves to be... a mistake.<br><br>The giant lollipop in the center of the store? The one that looked like an ornamental stand? It was real, it was for sale, and you had to carry it home since it was too heavy for Mana to carry. You wonder how long it will take her to finish it, and whether you should invest in some earplugs in the meantime."

You compliment her anyway, and the frown soon melts back into the ever-present enthusiastic grin as she gives nearby pedestrians wedgies."

You're not familiar with the girl, but you can tell that she's just accepted an offer from a confident young man, and the two of them slip discreetly into a nearby alley. As you turn to remind Mana that she promised not to interfere, you can see that she has already run ahead towards the pair. But instead of talking to her, Mana keeps her distance and watches from the safety some large crates. Soon, the both of you are watching him take the brunette from behind. When they are done and he has paid and left, Mana is silent so as not to give away her location. From the satisfied look on her face, you guess that she didn't want to talk so much as watch some sex."
