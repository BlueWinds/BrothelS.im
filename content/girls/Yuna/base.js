Though the temple tax is usually only paid by temple worshipers, the well-armed men tell you that to help recoup the costs of the wedding, the lord of the city has approved a temporary extension to the residents of your street. Their paperwork looks legitimate, and you notice that it is marked with the personal seal of High Priest Detic. You hear that the wedding did go on without Yuna - a veiled bride of uncertain name - but you\'d guess that he didn\'t take kindly to his intended skipping out. You have no option but to pay the men.",

Her husband is kind, she\'s in a position to help people, and she is learning a lot from the best tutors about the workings of her new homeland.<blockquote>I can never thank you enough for supporting me when I was in trouble.

It\'s hard to object when she decides to start trying on outfits - especially when they involve as little cloth as the ones she\'s picking out. Finally, you end up buying something for her, a pair of pants that seem like they might fall off at any moment. You hope that they do."
