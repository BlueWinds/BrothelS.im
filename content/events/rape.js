It was an efficient job - all she could make was muffled moans around the gag, and squirm slightly as they tore her clothes to shreds. Her eyes watered at the size of the cocks presented before her face and pressed at her ass, but she shuddered in relief as one of the men produced a tube of lubrication. No one came to help her as, one after another, they bent her over a pile of crates and satisfied their lust. It took hours.
