She screamed out, expecting pain, but it was muffled twofold - first by another appendage in her mouth, and second by a burst of ecstasy that left stars in her eyes. The creature didn\'t wait for her to recover, intent on its own pleasure - its limbs were well lubricated, slipping in and out in an increasing crescendo.<br><br>Unable to call out for help or move in the slightest, <<= girl.name >>\'s ass and pussy were used mercilessly for an hour and a half. Finally, at the sound of someone else approaching, the beast soundlessly withdrew down the sewer grate. The footsteps never reached her - whoever it was must have had better sense than to approach a dark alley at night. She lay in a senseless daze for several minutes before picking herself up and hurrying home."
