The Guild limits the number of establishments to prevent the price from dropping too low, but it doesn\'t much care who operates each particular one - after all, Guild leaders are the most successful and richest men in the city, nothing more and nothing less.<br><br>The permits are expected to run out by <strong>Day <<- mission.end.max.day >></strong> - and while there are more underhanded means available, the simplest method to get one is via a hefty bribe (<<- girl.name >> estimates $30-50k).",
