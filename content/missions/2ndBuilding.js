Well anyway, since he doesn't have any heirs and he left most of his property to the Guild, a whole bunch of licenses have just opened up, and I think you should take the chance to snag one of them.</blockquote>Even though you already have a license to operate an Adult Entertainment Building (or a brothel, as everyone except the official license granting you permission to operate one calls them), and in theory they're limited to one per person, it's an unwritten rule that prosperous owners can get permits for their \"second cousin, currently living abroad\" with no questions asked. The Guild limits the number of establishments to prevent the price from dropping too low, but it doesn't much care who operates each particular one - after all, the Guild leaders are the most successful and richest people in the city, nothing more and nothing less.<br><br>The permits are expected to both be available and run out on <strong>Day <<- mission.end.max.day >></strong> - and while there are more underhanded means available, the simplest method to get one is via a hefty bribe (<<- girl.name >> estimates $30-50k).",
